# DeepCCS_paper
Code and results from the DeepCCS paper


### Requirements   
The DeepCCS package must be installed because the notebooks are using some of its features.    
    
The Git LFS package (https://git-lfs.github.com/) is needed to download properly the archives of the DeepCCS_paper repository.   
Once it is installed, run the command `git lfs clone` instead of `git clone`.   



### Indications   
First decompress the archives to acces the results of the paper.    

To get the original results (no need to train the model yourself) see `DeepCCS_paper_results.ipynb`.   
To run again the model and check those results, see `DeepCCS_reproduce_results.ipynb`.   

To see how the internal representation was tested without having to train the model yourself see `Internal_representation_paper.ipynb`.   
To see how the internal representation was tested by training your own model see `Internal_representation_reproduce.ipynb`.
